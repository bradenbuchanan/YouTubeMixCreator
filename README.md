Description: 

    Identifying and downloading music from YouTube: You can use the youtube-dl library to download music from YouTube. You can also use the pytube3 library to access the metadata of a YouTube video, such as its title and artist. To download EDM music of a certain genre, you would need to find a way to search YouTube for videos that match that genre. One way to do this would be to search for keywords related to the genre in the video title or description.

    Creating a mix: Once you have downloaded the music, you'll need a way to mix it together. You can use a library like pydub to manipulate audio files. You'll need to write code to mix the tracks together in a way that sounds good. This might include adjusting the tempo, fading tracks in and out, and other techniques.

    Posting the mix to YouTube: Once you've created the mix, you'll need to upload it to YouTube. The google-auth and google-api-python-client libraries provide a way to access the YouTube API from Python. You'll need to write code to authenticate with the API, create a new video, and upload the mix to YouTube.

    Automation: To make the process automatic you can use tools such as cron job to schedule the script to run at specified time intervals.# YouTubeMixCreator
